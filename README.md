The repo for my dissertation.

To build, just do

```
make
```

Note 1: This assumues that you have the Minion Pro font installed on your computer. If not, please comment/uncomment the necessary lines in the preamble of `dissertation.tex`, and change the font specification in `code/relic_density.py` and `code/scatter.py`.

Note 2: This document contains a number of TikZ diagrams and PGF plots, so it might take a few minutes to compile the first time around (about 13 minutes on a late 2013 rMBP).
