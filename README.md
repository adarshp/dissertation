Smart Thesis
============

About
-----

This template is a re-implementation of the "classicthesis" template by André
Miede. However, it uses the "memoir" class as a basis, eliminating most
of the external packages required by "classicthesis" and thus (hopefully)
achieving a higher compatibility with other LaTeX packages. Large parts of
the code have been adapted (ransacked) from André Miedes code.

You can find more information about "classicthesis" at CTAN: https://www.ctan.org/pkg/classicthesis

More information about the "memoir" package can be found here: https://www.ctan.org/pkg/memoir

Usage
-----

Just download the smart-thesis repository into a subfolder of your project.
You can then use it like

````tex 
    \documentclass[a4paper,11pt]{memoir}
    
    \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
    \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
    
    \input{smart-thesis/style}
    
    \begin{documnet}
        % Your document here
    \end{document}
````

See the included demo document for more usage examples. You can find a selection of useful
packages and macros in the `common_packages.tex` and `common_macros.tex` files. Their inclusion
is fully optional.
