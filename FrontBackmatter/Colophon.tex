\section*{Colophon}
This thesis was designed using \LaTeX\ and the \texttt{memoir} package. The inspiration for the layout comes from the works of Edward Tufte and the \texttt{classicthesis} package by Andr√© Miede. Minion Pro is used for serif text, {\sffamily Scala Sans} for sans-serif text, and \texttt{Bitstream Vera Mono} for monospaced text.
