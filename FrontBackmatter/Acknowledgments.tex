\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to thank my advisor, Shufang Su, for her patient guidance and support throughout my graduate studies. Under her mentorship, I learned to critically examine scientific claims and to hold my own research to the highest standards. 
I would also like to thank the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Ken Johns, for letting me get a taste of experimental particle physics, career advice, and a fun semester teaching Scientific Computing.
\item Doug Toussaint, Sean Fleming, and Weigang Wang for agreeing to serve on my committee.
\item Abhay Shastry, Dheeraj Golla, and Rebekah Cross for their steady friendship these past six years.
\item Jessie Erikson, for being the most wonderful partner anyone could ask for.
\end{itemize}
% Family, friends, etc.
Finally, I would like to thank my family, and especially my parents for their unconditional love and encouragement during this process. It is a huge privilege to be able to pursue a doctorate, and I could not have done it without their support.
