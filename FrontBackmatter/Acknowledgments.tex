% Family, friends, etc.

We would like to thank Baradhwaj Coleppa for his participation at the beginning of the project described in chapter \ref{ch:LightChargedHiggs}. We would also like to thank  Peter Loch and Ken Johns for helpful discussions during the development of the projects in chapters \ref{ch:LightChargedHiggs} and \ref{ch:DM_100_TeV} respectively. Finally, we would like to thank Matthew Leone for helpful discussions about statistics in particle physics.

The work done in chapters \ref{ch:DM_100_TeV} and \ref{ch:ExoticHiggs} was supported in part by the Department of Energy (DoE) under Grant DE-FG02-13ER41976 / de-sc0009913. The work done for chapter \ref{ch:LightChargedHiggs} was also supported in part by the DoE under Grant~DE-FG02-13ER41976. An allocation of computer time from the UA Research Computing High Performance Computing (HPC) and High Throughput Computing (HTC) at the University of Arizona is also gratefully acknowledged for the work in chapters \ref{ch:DM_100_TeV} and \ref{ch:ExoticHiggs}.

I would also like to thank my parents, friends, and family for their unconditional support during this process.
