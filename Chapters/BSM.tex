\section{Extending the scalar sector: The Two-Higgs Doublet Model}

- Citations - (Felix papers)\\

Two-Higgs Doublet Models (2HDMs)\footnote{For a detailed review, see\citep{Branco2012}} are a class of theories that implement a simple, yet theoreticaly well-motivated extension to the SM - they expand the scalar sector of the SM by introducing an additional $SU(2)$ Higgs doublet field. In fact, the MSSM and related theories (such as the NMSSM and split SUSY), are types of 2HDMs.

\subsection{The 2HDM Lagrangian}
The most general scalar potential for two doublets $\Phi_1$ and $\Phi_2$ with hypercharge $+1$ is:
\begin{align*}
  V &= m_{11}^2\Phi_1^\dagger\Phi_1 + m_{22}^2\Phi_2^\dagger\Phi_2 - m_{12}^2\left(\Phi_1^\dagger\Phi_2 + \Phi_2^\dagger\Phi_1 \right) + \frac{\lambda_1}{2}\left(\Phi_1^\dagger\Phi_1 \right)^2 + \frac{\lambda_2}{2}\left(\Phi_2^\dagger\Phi_2 \right)^2\\
&  +\lambda_3\Phi_1^\dagger\Phi_1 \Phi_2^\dagger\Phi_2 + \lambda_4\Phi_1^\dagger\Phi_2 \Phi_2^\dagger\Phi_1 + \frac{\lambda_5}{2}\left[\left(\Phi_1^\dagger\Phi_2 \right)^2+\left(\Phi_2^\dagger\Phi_1\right)^2 \right]
\end{align*}

\subsection{The Type-II 2HDM}

In the type-II 2HDM, $\Phi_2$ couples to right-handed up-type quarks, while $\Phi_1$ couples to right-handed down-type quarks and right-handed leptons. The MSSM, which we will discuss later, is an example of a type-II 2HDM.

\subsection{The 2HDM mass spectrum}

After electroweak symmetry breaking, there are five mass eigenstates: the CP-even higgses $h$ and $H$, the CP-odd pseudoscalar Higgs $A$, and a pair of charged Higgses $H^\pm$.

\subsection{Interactions}

The interactions of these additional scalar particles are given by the Yukawa terms of of the Lagrangian:
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{L}^{\mathrm{2HDM}}_{\text{Yukawa}} =& - \sum_{f = u, d, l} \frac{m_f}{v}
\left(\xi_h^f \overline{f}fh+\xi_H^f \overline{f}fH-i\xi_A^f \overline{f}\gamma_5fA \right)\\
&-\left\{\frac{\sqrt{2}V_{ud}}{v}\overline{u}\left(m_u\xi_A^uP_l+m_d\xi_A^dP_R\right)dH^+ + \frac{\sqrt{2}m_l\xi^l_A}{v}\overline{\nu}_Ll_RH^+ + h.c.\right\}
\end{align*}
\section{Supersymmetry and the MSSM}
\subsection{Motivations}
\subsubsection{The hierarchy problem}
The mass of the Higgs boson is not protected by any symmetry, and so is highly susceptible to quantum corrections. However, we see that the mass is 126 GeV. Thus, quantum corrections much larger than its mass have to be canceled out somehow. An elegant mechanism for doing this is \emph{supersymmetry}.
\subsubsection{Stable dark matter candidate}
The MSSM has a new kind of symmetry known as \emph{R-parity}. The consequence of this is that the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) must be absolutely stable, that is, it cannot decay further into other particles.
\subsubsection{Gauge coupling unification}
The MSSM leads to the unification of the strong and electroweak forces at high energies, similar to how the electromagnetic and weak forces unify at high energies.

\section{Split Supersymmetry}

The non-SM interactions in our signal process are the higgsino-bino-$Z$ and the higgsino-bino-$h$ interactions. To determine their coupling, we can inspect the structure of the MSSM. We will first examine the gauge interactions of higgsino and bino gauge eigenstates. Upon doing this, it will be apparent that there are no interaction terms containing both pure higgsinos and pure binos. The reason is that electroweak symmetry breaking induces mixing among the neutralinos. After this, we will move on to the coupling involving the SM Higgs boson, and see how it is obtained. 
All the particles in the MSSM are grouped into structures known as supermultiplets. They come in two varieties: \emph{chiral} and \emph{gauge} supermultiplets. The SM fermions and the components of the SM Higgs doublet reside inchiral supermultiplets, and the SM gauge bosons reside in gauge supermultiplets. Let us first look at what the gauge interactions of a generic chiral and gauge supermultiplet look like.
For a generic chiral supermultiplet consisting of a complex scalar $\phi$ and its superpartner, a two-component Weyl fermion $\psi$, the kinetic terms are 
\[\mathcal{L}_{\text{chiral,kinetic,fermion}} = -\partial^\mu\phi^*\partial_\mu\phi + i\psi^{\dagger}\overline{\sigma}^\mu\partial_\mu\psi.\]
If the Lagrangian density is invariant under gauge transformations of the chiral supermultiplet under a gauge group with generators $(T^a)_i^j$ and associated gauge fields $A_\mu^a$, the partial derivatives above can be promoted to covariant derivatives:
\begin{align}
  \nabla_\mu\phi_i &= \partial_\mu\phi_i - igA_\mu^a(T^a\phi)_i\label{eq:phi1}\\
  \nabla_\mu\phi^{*i} &= \partial_\mu\phi^{*i} + igA_\mu^a(\phi^*T^a)^{i}\label{eq:phi2}\\
  \nabla_\mu\psi_i &= \partial_\mu\psi_i - igA_\mu^a(T^a\psi)_i\label{eq:psi}
\end{align}
In the MSSM, there are two $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ Higgs doublets instead of the one that we encounter in the standard model.
\[H_u = \begin{pmatrix}H_u^+\\H_u^0\end{pmatrix};
H_d = \begin{pmatrix}H_d^0\\H_d^-\end{pmatrix}\]
Inserting the covariant derivatives into the kinetic terms will yield the interaction terms. Each of the fields $H_u$ and $H_d$ can be interpreted as the scalar field $\phi$ in \autoref{eq:phi1} and \autoref{eq:phi2}. Similarly, the supersymmetrizations of $H_u$ and $H_d$,
\[\widetilde{H_u} = \begin{pmatrix}\widetilde{H_u}^+\\\widetilde{H_u}^0\end{pmatrix};
\widetilde{H_d} = \begin{pmatrix}\widetilde{H_d}^0\\\widetilde{H_d}^-\end{pmatrix}\]
can be equated with the field $\psi$ in \autoref{eq:psi}. The component fields of these are called \emph{higgsinos}. Once we insert the generators and associated gauge fields for the $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ symmetry in the covariant derivatives, and mix the gauge fields in the manner dictated by electroweak symmetry breaking, the gauge interactions of the higgs and higgsino fields look a lot like the SM interactions. In fact, they will have the same strength. Since we are interested in neutral higgsino-like NLSPs for our signal process, let us isolate their particular interaction terms:
\[\frac{g}{\cos\theta_W}Z_\mu\left(\widetilde{H_u}^{0\dagger}\overline{\sigma}^\mu \widetilde{H_u}+
\widetilde{H_d}^{0\dagger}\overline{\sigma}^\mu \widetilde{H_d}\right)\]
Now let us turn to the interactions of gauge supermultiplets. A generic gauge supermultiplet will consist of a gauge boson $A_\mu^a$ and its two-component Weyl fermion superpartner, the \emph{gaugino} $\lambda^a$. The SM gauge bosons reside in such gauge supermultiplets, and so the index $a$ runs over the adjoint representation of the relevant gauge group. The gauge interactions of gauginos can be extracted from their kinetic term in the Lagrangian:
\[\mathcal{L}_{\text{gaugino,kinetic}} = i\lambda^{a\dagger}\overline{\sigma}^\mu\nabla_\mu\lambda^a\]
where the covariant derivative is given by
\[\nabla_\mu\lambda^a = \partial_\mu\lambda^a + gf^{abc}A_\mu^b\lambda^c.\]
The factors $f^{abc}$ represent the structure constants of the gauge group. Thus, the interaction term would look like:
\[ig\lambda^{a\dagger}\overline{\sigma}^\mu f^{abc}A_\mu^b\lambda^c\]
The bino $(\widetilde{B}^0)$ is the superpartner of the SM gauge boson associated with the $U(1)_Y$ (hypercharge) gauge symmetry. Thus, it will transform in the adjoint representation of $U(1)_Y$ as well. However, this implies that there can never be a interaction vertex containing a bino and a gauge boson, since the structure constants for $U(1)_Y$ are all simply 0. In addition, we have previously seen that examining the chiral supermultiplet conaining the higgsino does not yield a neutral higgsino-bino-$Z$ vertex either. The reason that we can consider such a vertex in our signal process is due to the fact that electroweak symmetry breaking induces mixing among neutral higgsinos, binos, and the neutral wino $(\widetilde{W}^0)$, the superpartner of the $W_\mu^3$ gauge field associated with the SM $SU(2)_L$ gauge symmetry that mixes with $B_\mu$ to form the $Z$ boson and photon.

\section{Dark Matter}
\subsection{History of Dark Matter}\label{history-of-dark-matter}

In 1933, the Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky turned his telescope to the night sky to measure the velocities of galaxies in a particular galaxy cluster known as the Coma cluster. He discovered that the visible matter in this cluster could not account for the speeds at which the galaxies were moving. He postulated that there must be some matter that does not emit light, but has mass and interacts only gravitationally with known matter. He termed this `Dunkle materie', or \emph{dark matter}. The evidence for dark matter has only continued to grow since then, and we now know that there is far more of it in the universe than there is regular, or \emph{baryonic} matter. The nature of dark matter is one of the most compelling mysteries in physics today.

Over the years, there have been many dark matter candidates\footnote{For a while, it was debated whether the effects of dark matter could instead be explained by a deviation of the gravitational force from the usual inverse square law at large length scales. This theory was termed Modified Newtonian Dynamics, or MOND \citep{Milgrom1983}. However, it was shown in 2006 \citep{Clowe2006} that MOND was fundamentally incompatible with the data from the bullet cluster.}, but the most widely accepted view today is that dark matter is comprised of a completely new kind of particle \footnote{Of course, this is not the only possibility. Instead of a single dark matter candidate particle, there could be a 'dark sector' comprised of multiple particles and interactions between them. See (DDM papers) for developments along this line.} that interacts only weakly with the particles of the Standard Model and moves at at non-relativistic speeds.

\end{sidecaption}
\end{figure}
One of the most tantalizing clues to the nature of dark matter is the so-called 'WIMP miracle' - the remarkable coincidence that the observed dark matter density in the universe can arises naturally from a particle with mass and couplings comparable to the weak scale. This raises the hope that such particles might feasibly be detected at colliders or direct detection experiments.

\subsection{Dark matter, three ways}\label{dark-matter-three-ways}

There are three main methods of detecting WIMP dark matter. The first, direct detection, involves constructing a well shielded, giant vat of a relatively inert substance, and waiting for dark matter particles to interact with that substance. The second, termed indirect detection, involves searching for signs of dark matter particles annihilating each other in the cosmos. The third method, collider detection, involves producing dark matter through high energy particle collisions and searching for their associated signatures. The first two methods place relatively stringent constraints on the nature of dark matter, but have their own limitations. The smallest interaction cross-section between dark matter and regular matter that direct detection can measure is limited from below by the background of neutrinos from the sun, though there are creative methods that are being developed to deal with this background. Indirect detection suffers from large astrophysical uncertainties. Collider detection, therefore, is competitive with, and can even possibly surpass the other two methods.

\section{Calculation of the thermal relic density}

Assuming that the present-day abundance of WIMP dark matter is explained by a thermal history, the observed density of dark matter, known as the \emph{relic density} sets limits on particle dark matter candidates. We will briefly go over the standard calculation of the thermal relic density.

\newcommand{\fxv}{f(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v})}

Consider the phase-space density of a single particle dark matter candidate in phase space, given by $\fxv$. That is, the probability of finding the particle with a position of $\mathbf{x}$ and velocity $\mathbf{v}$ is given by $\fxv d^3\mathbf{x}d^3\mathbf{v}$ \footnote{insert references}.
The time evolution of this phase-space density is given by Boltzmann's equation:
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{L}f = \mathbf{C}f.
\end{equation}
Here, $\mathbf{L}$ is the Liouville operator, which in the non-relativistic limit reduces to 
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{L}_\text{nr}f = \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + \mathbf{\dot{x}}\frac{\partial f}{\partial\mathbf{x}} + \mathbf{\dot{v}}\frac{\partial f}{\partial \mathbf{v}} = \frac{d}{dt}
\end{equation}
The general-relativistic version of this operator is obtained by taking the total derivative along a world line parameterized by some affine parameter, say  $\lambda$.
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{L} = \frac{d}{d\lambda} = \frac{dx^\mu}{d\lambda}\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\mu} + \frac{dp^\mu}{d\lambda}\frac{\partial}{\partial p^\mu}
\end{equation}
We can choose to normalize this parameter as follows:
\begin{equation}
  p^\mu = \frac{dx^\mu}{d\lambda} = m\frac{dx^\mu}{d\tau}
\end{equation}
where $\tau$ is the proper time. With this normalization, the geodesic equation becomes
\begin{equation}
  \frac{dp^\mu}{d\lambda}+\Gamma^{\mu}_{\alpha\beta}p^\alpha p^\beta = 0
\end{equation}
If we assume that there are no external non-gravitational forces, trajectory of the DM particle through phase space will be described by the geodesic. Thus, we can write the general-relativistic Liouville operator as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gr_liouville_operator}
  \mathbf{L} = p^\mu\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\mu} - \Gamma^\mu_{\alpha\beta}p^\alpha p^\beta\frac{\partial}{\partial p^\mu}
\end{equation}
The isotropy of the model implies that the phase-space density \emph{f} is devoid of directionality - it will depend only on the energy \emph{E} and time \emph{t}, and can be written as $f(E,t)$. Thus, all the partial derivatives in \autoref{eq:gr_liouville_operator} will vanish except for those corresponding to $\mu = 0$. If the connections $\Gamma^\mu_{\alpha\beta}$ are calculated for the FLRW metric (see \autoref{sec:sm_cosmology}), the Liouville operator simplifies to
\begin{equation}\label{eq:frw_liouville_operator}
  \mathbf{L}f = E\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + H|\mathbf{p}|^2 \frac{\partial f}{\partial E}
\end{equation}
where $H$ is the Hubble parameter. The number density \emph{n} is given by the integral of $f(E,t)$ over all of phase-space, given by
\begin{align}
  n = 4\pi g\int dp p^2 f(E,t)
\end{align}
where $p = |\mathbf{p}|$, and $g$ is the number of spin degrees of freedom.
Dividing \autoref{eq:frw_liouville_operator} by E and integrating over the momentum coordinates gives us:
\begin{align}
  4\pi g\int dp p^2 \frac{\mathbf{L}f}{E} = 4\pi g\int dp p^2 \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}- H\frac{p^2}{E}\frac{\partial f}{\partial E}\right)
\end{align}
Pulling the partial derivative outside the integral for the first term gives us
\begin{equation}
  \frac{dn}{dt} - 4\pi gH\int dp\frac{p^4}{E}\frac{\partial f}{\partial E}
\end{equation}
We know that $E^2 = p^2 - m^2$, thus $\frac{1}{E}\frac{\partial}{\partial E} = \frac{1}{p}\frac{\partial}{\partial p}$. Substituting this into the previous equation gives us:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:n_dot}
  \dot{n} - 4\pi gH\int dp p^3 \frac{\partial f}{\partial p}
\end{equation}
We can simplify the second term using integration by parts:
\begin{equation}
  \int dp p^3\frac{\partial f}{\partial p} = fp^3|_{0}^\infty - \int dp (3p^2 f)
\end{equation}
The first term on the right hand side of the above equation should evaluate to zero, since the probability of the particle having an infinite momentum must be zero. Substituting this expression into \autoref{eq:n_dot} and simplifying gives us
\begin{equation}\label{eq:simplified_n_density}
  \dot{n}+3Hn = 4\pi g\int \frac{dpp^2}{E}\mathbf{C}f
\end{equation}
The operator \textbf{C} is known as the \emph{collision} operator, and contains the information about how the dark matter particles interact with themselves and other particles. For a process of the form $1+2\rightarrow 3+4$, the collision term (on the right hand side of the above equation) for particle 1 takes the form  
\begin{marginfigure}
  \feynmandiagram[horizontal = chi2 to SM1]{
    {chi1 [particle = \(\chi\)], chi2 [particle = \(\chi\)],

  };

  \caption{Dark matter annihilating to SM particles.}
\end{marginfigure}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:collision_term}
  \begin{split}
  &-\sum_\text{spins}\int [f_1 f_2(1\pm f_3)(1\pm f_4)|\mathcal{M}_{12\rightarrow 34}|^2 + f_3 f_4(1\pm f_1)(1\pm f_2)|\mathcal{M}_{34\rightarrow 12}|^2]\\
&\times(2\pi)^4\delta^4(p_1+p_2-p_3-p_4)d\Pi_1 d\Pi_2 d\Pi_3 d\Pi_4
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where
\[d\Pi_i = \frac{d^3 p_i}{(2\pi)^3 2E_i}\]
are phase-space integration factors. This can be simplified considerably by assuming the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The early universe is in thermal equilibrium, and thus the phase-space distribution $f$ takes either Fermi-Dirac or Bose-Einstein form.
  \item The temperature of each species, $T_i$ is low enough that the condition $T_i \ll E_i - \mu_i$, where $\mu_i$ is its chemical potential. This means that their phase-space distributions are approximately of the Maxwell-Boltzmann form, and we can neglect the statistical factors: $(1+f)\approx 1$.
\end{itemize}
The amplitude for the forward and backwards processes should be equal:
\[|\mathcal{M}_{12\rightarrow 34}|^2 = |\mathcal{M}_{34\rightarrow 12}|^2 = |\mathcal{M}|^2 \]
Then the expression in \autoref{eq:collision_term} simplifies to
\begin{equation}
-\sum_\text{spins}\int(f_1 f_2 - f_3 f_4)|\mathcal{M}|^2(2\pi)^4\delta(p_1 + p_2 - p_3 - p_4)d\Pi_1 d\Pi_2 d\Pi_3 d\Pi_4
\end{equation}
We can relate the matrix element to the cross section as follows:
\[\sum_\text{spins}|\mathcal{M}_{ij\rightarrow kl}|^2\times(2\pi)^4\delta^4(p_i + p_j - p_k -p_l)d\Pi_jd\Pi_k = 4g_ig_j\sigma_{ij}\sqrt{(p_i\cdot p_j)^2 - (m_im_j)^2}\]
where $\sigma_{ij}$ is the scattering cross section. Let us define the M\o ller velocity,
\[v_\text{M\o l} = \frac{\sqrt{(p_i\cdot p_j)^2 - (m_im_j)^2}}{E_iE_j}\]
Substituting this in the collision term and noting that $f_i(2E_i)d\Pi_i = dn_i$, we get the collision term as
\[g_1\int \mathbf{C}f_1\frac{d^3p_1}{(2\pi)^3} = -\int[(\sigma v_\text{M\o l})_{12}dn_1dn_2 - (\sigma v_\text{M\o l})_{34}dn_3dn_4]\]
The quantity $\sigma v_\text{M\o l}$ is relatively independent of the number densities $n_i$, and thus can be taken outside the integral, to give us
\[\dot{n}_1 + 3Hn_1 = -\langle\sigma v\rangle_{12}n_1n_2 + \langle\sigma v\rangle_{34}n_3n_4.\]
where $v = v_\text{M\o l}$. Let us now apply this result to the specific $2\rightarrow 2$ annihilation case shown in \autoref{fig:dm_annihilation}. The incoming DM particles are identical, with number density \emph{n}. When the DM particles are in equilibrium with the SM particles, a condition known as \emph{detailed balance} holds that relates the number densities and annihilation cross sections for the SM and DM particles:
\[\langle\sigma v\rangle_{12}n^2_\text{eq}=\langle\sigma v\rangle_{34}n_3^\text{eq}n_4^\text{eq}\]
Thus, the Boltzmann equation can be written as
\[\dot{n}+3Hn = \langle\sigma v\rangle (n_\text{eq}^2 - n^2)\]
where $\langle\sigma v\rangle = \langle\sigma v\rangle_{12}$. Intuitively, the number density $n$ will decrease naturally as the universe expands. If we want to focus on the effects of collision, we should define a \emph{comoving number density} $Y = n/s$, where $s$ is the total entropy density of the universe. If the dominant contribution to \emph{s} comes from thermal radiation, then $sa^3$ will be approximately constant. Rewriting the Boltzmann equation in terms of $Y$ gives us
\[\frac{dY}{dt} = \langle\sigma v\rangle s (Y_\text{eq}^2 - Y^2)\]
As the early radiation-dominated universe expanded, it also cooled down. It is expedient to write the above equation in terms of temperature, using the variable $x = m/T$, where \emph{m} is the mass of the DM particle. 
\[\frac{dY}{dx} = -\frac{\langle\sigma v\rangle s}{H(x)x}\]
The thermally averaged cross-section times velocity is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:thermal_sigma_v}
  \langle\sigma v\rangle = \frac{\int\sigma vdn_1^\text{eq}dn_2^\text{eq}}{\int dn_1^\text{eq}dn_2^\text{eq}}
  =\frac{\int \sigma v e^{-E_1/T}e^{-E_2/T}d^3p_1d^3p_2}{\int e^{-E_1/T}e^{-E_2/T}d^3p_1d^3p_2}
\end{equation}
The momentum-space volume element in spherical coordinates is
\[d^3p_1d^3p_2 = 4\pi |\mathbf{p}_1|dE_14\pi |\mathbf{p}_2|dE_2\frac{1}{2}d(\cos\theta)\]
where $\theta$ is the angle between the 3-momenta $\mathbf{p}_1$ and $\mathbf{p}_2$. We can then change the integration variables to $E_+, E_-, s$, given by
\begin{align}
  E_+ &= E_1 + E_2\\
  E_- &= E_1 - E_2,\\
  s &= 2m^2 + 2E_1E_2-2\mathbf{p}_1\mathbf{p}_2\cos\theta
\end{align}
Thus the volume element in these variables becomes
\[d^3p_1d^3p_2 = 2\pi^2E_1E_2dE_+dE_-ds\]
And the integration limits become
\begin{align}
  |E_1| &\leq \sqrt{1-\frac{4m^2}{s}}\sqrt{E_+^2 - s}\\
  E_+ &\geq \sqrt{s}\\
  s &\geq 4m^2
\end{align}
With these variables, the numerator in \autoref{eq:thermal_sigma_v} becomes
\begin{align*}
  &2\pi^2\int dE_+\int dE_-\int ds(\sigma v)E_1E_2e^{-E_+/T}\\
  =&4\pi^2\int ds\sigma \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{s(s-4m^2)}\sqrt{1-\frac{4m^2}{s}}\int dE_+e^{-E_+/T}\sqrt{E_+-s}\\
  =&2\pi^2T\int ds\sigma(s-4m^2)\sqrt{s}K_1(\sqrt{s}/T)
\end{align*}
Similarly, the denominator simplifies to $[4\pi m^2TK_2(m/T)]^2$. The functions $K_i$ are modified Bessel functions of order \emph{i}\footnote{The ordinary differential equation
  \begin{equation*}
    x^2\ddot{y} + x\dot{y} - (x^2+n^2)y = 0
  \end{equation*}
  admits solutions of the form $y = c_1 I_n(x) + c_2K_n(x)$. The functions $I_n$ and $K_n$ are known as modified Bessel functions of the first and second kinds, respectively.
}. Thus \autoref{eq:thermal_sigma_v} simplifies to
\[\langle\sigma v\rangle = \frac{1}{8m^4TK_2^2(m/T)}\int_{4m^2}^\infty\sigma(s-4m^2)\sqrt{s}K_1(\sqrt{s}/T)ds\]
In this non-relativistic limit, this simplifies to
\[\langle\sigma v\rangle \approx b_0 + \frac{3}{2}b_1x^{-1} + ...\]
The coefficients $b_0, b_1, ...$ correspond to \emph{s}-wave, \emph{p}-wave annihilation, and so on.
