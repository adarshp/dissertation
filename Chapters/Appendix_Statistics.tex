\section{Probability basics}

In this section we will describe Poisson frequency function that is commonly used for counting experiments such as in particle physics. We will first start with the Bernoulli or Binomial frequency function, and then build upon that to arrive at the Poisson frequency function. The discussion roughly follows that in \citep{Melissinos}.
